This repository studies some of the options you can have for a trip to Paris from Madrid on the weekend 22-25 of november. It uses webscraping techniques such as python library beautiful soup to iter through a variety of different websites (TripAdvisor,Civitatis, etc...) so information relative to the trips can be obtained. Mainly information of the price of the flights and several activities has been retireved for different example groups: for a family of four (2 adults 2 under-15 children) very interesting activities have been found. From Civitatis´ website: A citiviewing tour through the river Seine, a field trip to Versailles, free tours to Montmatre or a fast escapade to Disneyland Paris are some of the family-friendly activities found. also, a study of the flights has been conducted between Madrid and the main airports in Paris, taking avaliable flights for the cited dates. I found that Madrid is the airport with the most extreme price range (Greatest outliers), but Paris-Orly has more expensive flights on a normal basis. The most expensive average flight goes to Madrid again: In the linked Repo, you can find results for other profiles, which have given different insights. For example, couples are more likely to find much more expensive flights, and Charles de Gaulle seems to be the most expensive airport both for friends or couples. If you are a lone traveller it is also the most expensive on average, just after Madrid.

As of flights from origin. The absolute cheapest go to Paris Beauvais, while Madrid sends the most planes. If you are a couple you can find even cheaper flights in Paris-Orly and Madrid, and the most flights come from Orly For a friend group, parting from Orly to Madrid is the best option, If you are a lone traveller that is also true, and Charles de Gaulle amd Madrid also have the greatest range of flights and prices if you are looking for an emmission-saving trip

Hostal-wise, there are lots of places to choose in Paris, prices for a couple range around 450€ for three days for one room, while a single room on average is around 320€. A family can expect to pay at least 900€ for 4 members, two adults and two children. A simmilar price that a group of five would pay.

In comparison to Paris, Madrid is cheaper and for couples it has a wider offer of hotels, you can compare through graphs in the repository. Also activities in both cities are promising, entertaining and guarantee a great time!

For the future, I would like to employ the library selenium to webscrap the activities price and obtain some insightful eco-friendly activities. Also, both API calls and plottings can take asyncrony. A more insightful EDA would be likable too, taking into account all the raw data I was able to catch.

Thanks for reading!
